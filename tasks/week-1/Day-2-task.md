# Task 1: Study Chapters of The Rust Book

## Objective

Study the **remaining of Chapter 2** and **all of Chapter 3** of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and:

- Summarize what you understand.
- List what you do **not** understand.

This way, we can all **collaboratively share knowledge** and **identify our gaps**.

# Task 2: Basic Arithmetic in Rust

## Objective

Write a Rust program with separate functions to:

- Add two numbers
- Subtract two numbers
- Multiply two numbers
- Divide two numbers
- Run the program at once so you can get all the results and find a good way to distinguish the 4 function call outputs.
- Then you should attach a screenshot of the printed version, just one image containing the result of the logs of that function.

Then call each of them in `main()` with values and run the program using `cargo run`.
